# Contributing

Small, focused improvements are welcome. Describe the user-visible problem and
check for an existing issue before starting a large feature. The project targets
Omarchy on Linux; the supported Python baseline is 3.11.

Automated contributors must also follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which covers
public-data hygiene, maintenance standards, and safe publishing.

## Set up

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wombatoperator/omarchy-voice.git
cd omarchy-voice
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Use the GitHub noreply email shown in your account's email settings for this
repository's `git config user.email`. Commit and push hooks check staged content,
commit identities, and complete pushed ancestry. Do not bypass a privacy failure.

The editable Python install provides `omarchy-voice` and `omarchy-vision`; it does
not install desktop bindings, widgets, or a user service. Use `./install.sh` for that
integration. Unit tests do not require an API key or a running Omarchy desktop.

## Validate a change

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m compileall -q src tests tools
bash -n install.sh uninstall.sh share/install-paths.sh
python tools/check_public_files.py --staged
python -m build
```

`scripts/quality-gate.sh` runs the syntax checks, the unit suite, and the
publication history scan in one step with the locked dependencies.

CI runs the full unit suite on Python 3.11 and 3.14, builds the distribution, and
checks publication history. Local test sockets must be permitted; a sandbox that
blocks them can prevent network and control-socket tests from running. Do not
weaken production security to make a test pass.

For documentation-only changes, check relative links and command syntax, compare
TOML examples with `src/omarchy_voice/config.py`, and run `git diff --check` plus
the staged publication scan. Do not execute example actions or paid probes just
to check their syntax. Keep behavior tests for changes to executable code.

Keep tests that verify behavior, failure handling, and execution boundaries.
When removing a feature or development-only tool, remove its orphaned tests too.
Avoid tests that only repeat implementation details. Use synthetic data, fake
providers, and temporary directories; never commit a real desktop transcript or
credential as a fixture.

Optional integration checks run outside CI:

| Command | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `python tools/check_live.py --connect` | Paid API protocol probe with synthetic silence; no microphone or desktop access |
| `python tools/check_tasks.py` | Temporary systemd workers and bubblewrap with a fake provider; no model API calls |
| `python tools/trace_summary.py /path/to/live-trace.jsonl` | Local trace analysis; output may still contain private identifiers/errors |

Read a check's help and requirements before running it. Keep generated evidence
under ignored `benchmarks/` or `docs/private/` and inspect it before sharing.

## Find the code

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/omarchy_voice/` | Voice engines, desktop tools, camera companion, policy, and durable workers |
| `tests/` | Automated behavior and security regressions |
| `tools/` | Publication checks, opt-in integration checks, trace analysis |
| `share/`, `omarchy/`, `plugin/` | Desktop configuration, command wrappers, and widgets |
| `docs/` | User and contributor reference guides |

The package version lives in `src/omarchy_voice/__init__.py`. `pyproject.toml`
reads it when building. Wheels contain the Python application; source archives
also contain the installer, integration files, guides, and tests.

## Send a pull request

Explain the problem, the resulting behavior, and how you verified it. Include
reproduction steps or a synthetic example when useful. Update the relevant guide
when a command, configuration option, or trust boundary changes. Keep unrelated
formatting and refactoring separate. Be respectful and discuss the code and its
behavior rather than the contributor.
